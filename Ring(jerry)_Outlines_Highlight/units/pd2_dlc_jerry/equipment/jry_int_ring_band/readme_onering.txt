! v.1 7/7/16 !
***Install directions:***

1. Extract contents of .zip, which you've probably already done.

2. Place the folder named "To Rule Them All" in your mod_overrides folder. If you don't know what that is, you probably shouldn't be installing this mod.

3. Boot PAYDAY 2; rob banks.

--

If outlines feel too easy for you, replace the file with remove the material file for jry_prop_ring_band and rename the alternate file to take its place. Again, if you don't know how to do this, you probably should not be installing this mod.
The ALTERNATE file removes the yellow outline, but makes the ring still faintly visible through walls. That way it's not a blinding beacon of one-ring-ness, but more of a reassurance that you haven't missed a ring in your quest to rule Middle Earth with an iron Empty Palm Kata.
Have fun.
